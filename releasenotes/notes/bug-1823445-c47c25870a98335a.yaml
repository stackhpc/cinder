    Fixed the volume property `signature_verified` propagating to images created
    from volumes. That property could later conflict with the same property being
    added again when creating a new volume from such image, preventing the volume
    from being created successfully. This volume property is created whenever a
    volume is created from an image for the purpose of indicating that the image
    signature was verified on creation, and was not intended to be propagated
    further if a new image is created from such volume.
