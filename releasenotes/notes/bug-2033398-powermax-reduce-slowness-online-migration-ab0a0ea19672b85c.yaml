    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/2033398>`_: Reduced
    the risk of failures when doing online migration.
    This change is to speed up the deletion of a volume which doesn't

    This removal will allow to save 15s in terms of operation time
    and avoid unnecessary pausing time during migration.
